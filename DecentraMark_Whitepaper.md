# DecentraMK-I

**DecentraMK-I** is a decentralized application (dApp) that empowers creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators to mint and timestamp trademark-like identifiers as NFTs on the XRPL. It leverages Web3 technologies to give users immutable proof of originality, backed by IPFS, and integrated with the XUMM wallet for seamless XRPL transactions.

## 🧩 Why It Matters

Trademarks are critical assets, but traditional systems are slow, expensive, and jurisdiction-limited. DecentraMK-I decentralizes the process, providing early-proof-of-use without costly legal overhead. It is **not a replacement for legal registration**, but a trustless timestamp layer with practical utility.
